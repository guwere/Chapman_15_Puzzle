This is a java GUI implementation of the 15-Puzzle. 
The goal is to arrange the squares sequentially from 0 onwards. You can create any sized board but anything bigger than 4x4 is really hard to solve. 
The black square represents the empty hole. To move it click on adjacent squares to the black box. 
There is a bug right now where an unsolvable puzzle is generated even though the "generate solvable" option was selected. In such case the console will display a "false" message when you start the program. 

To start the program type the command "java -jar Chapman\ 15\ Puzzle.jar" from the "Chapman_15_Puzzle_jar" directory
